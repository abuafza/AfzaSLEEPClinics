                  <h3>OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA</h3>
                  <p>
                    Obstructive sleep apnea is a common and serious sleep disorder that causes you to stop 
                    breathing during sleep. The airway repeatedly becomes blocked, limiting the amount of 
                    air that reaches your lungs. When this happens, you may snore loudly or making choking 
                    noises as you try to breathe. Your brain and body becomes oxygen deprived and you may 
                    wake up. This may happen a few times a night, or in more severe cases, several hundred 
                    times a night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In many cases, an apnea, or temporary pause in breathing, is caused by the tissue in the 
                    back of the throat collapsing. The muscles of the upper airway relax when you fall asleep. 
                    If you sleep on your back, gravity can cause the tongue to fall back. This narrows the airway, 
                    which reduces the amount of air that can reach your lungs. The narrowed airway causes snoring 
                    by making the tissue in back of the throat vibrate as you breathe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lack of oxygen your body receives can have negative long-term consequences 
                    for your health. This includes:

                  <h3>CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA</h3>
                  <p>
                    Central sleep apnea occurs when your brain doesn’t send proper signals to the 
                    muscles that control breathing. Central sleep apnea is less common form of sleep apnea. 
                    This means you make no effort to breathe for a short period of time. You may awaken with 
                    shortness of breath or have a difficult time getting to sleep or staying asleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Central sleep apnea is a breathing disorder that causes your body to decrease or stop 
                    the effort of breathing during sleep. This occurs in an off-and-on cycle. It is a result
                    of a problem in the brain or heart. It is different from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
                    because the problem is not caused by a blockage of the airway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The brain and heart normally interact to direct, monitor, and change the amount of air 
                    that we breathe. The problem in central sleep apnea syndromes (CSA) is that the brain 
                    and heart move an abnormal amount of air into the lungs

                    <h3>INSOMNIA</h3>
                    <p>
                    Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. It occurs when you
                    have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep even though you had the opportunity 
                    to get a full night of sleep. The causes, symptoms and severity of insomnia vary from 
                    person to person. Insomnia may include:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Difficulty falling asleep</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Difficulty staying asleep throughout the night</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Waking up too early in the morning</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Insomnia involves both a sleep disturbance and daytime symptoms. The effects 
                        of insomnia can impact nearly every aspect of your life. Studies show that 
                        insomnia negatively affects work performance, impairs decision-making and can 
                        damage relationships. In most cases, people with insomnia report a worse overall 
                        quality of life. Everyone has the occasional night of poor sleep. In many cases this 
                        is due to staying up too late or waking up too early. This does not mean you have 
                        insomnia, it means you didn’t get enough sleep.

                    <h3>NARCOLEPSY</h3>
                    <p>
                        Narcolepsy is a lifelong sleep disorder that makes you feel overwhelmingly tired, 
                        and in severe cases, have sudden uncontrollable sleep attacks. Narcolepsy can impact 
                        nearly every aspect of your life. It is dangerous because you can have excessive 
                        sleepiness or a sleep attack at any time of the day, in the middle of any activity 
                        including eating, walking or driving. Operating a vehicle with untreated narcolepsy 
                        can be very dangerous and some states even have laws against it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many people with narcolepsy do not know they have the sleep disorder. About one in 
                        2,000 people have some form of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy may run in some families, 
                        but most cases are not genetic. The disorder is extremely rare in children. The 
                        cause of narcolepsy is still unknown, but recent research suggests that many people 
                        with narcolepsy with cataplexy have low levels of the neurotransmitter hypocretin, 
                        a chemical that regulates arousal, wakefulness and appetite.

                    <h3>RESTLESS LEG SYNDROM (RLS)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Restless legs syndrome is a neurological sleep disorder that make you have an 
                        overwhelming urge to move your legs. Restless legs syndrome makes it difficult to 
                        get comfortable enough to fall asleep. The symptoms are usually worse at night. The 
                        sensation is difficult for some people to describe. You may lie down and begin to 
                        feel burning or itching inside your legs. If you move your legs or get up and walk 
                        around, these symptoms may go away. The discomfort may return when you try again to 
                        go to sleep.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Restless legs syndrome may cause you to get fewer hours of sleep each night. Many 
                        people with severe cases get less than five hours of sleep per night. Milder cases 
                        do not disturb your sleep as much, though the sleep may be of poorer quality.

                    <h3>SHIFT WORK DISORDER</h3>
                    <p>
                        Shift work disorder occurs when you have difficulties adjusting to a work schedule 
                        that takes place during a time which most people sleep. When you have shift work disorder, 
                        there is a conflict between your body’s circadian rhythms and your work schedule. You may 
                        have to be at work when your body wants to sleep. Then when you have to sleep, you body 
                        expects to be awake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People with shift work disorder may sleep up to four hours less than the average worker. 
                        Shift work disorder causes you to have trouble sleeping or be severely tired. The quality 
                        of sleep may be poor, and you may wake up feeling unrefreshed. You may feel fatigued or 
                        exhausted. This can hurt your performance at work, and can put you at risk for making a 
                        costly mistake or getting injured on the job.
